                    <p>As a software developer coop, I was responsible for collaborating with our development team to deliver high-quality software solutions, that would increase the efficiency of team operations, and also test software solutions made to ensure they were bug-free and client-ready when released. During this coop, I worked on making tools to increase efficiency in reporting on testing results. In addition, I created a testing framework to test an application that collected the data on the testing devices used by the team. Furthermore, I served as scrum master during multiple scrums hosting scrum meetings and gaining experience in an agile work environment.</p>

                    <p>As a software developer coop, I was responsible for collaborating with our development team to deliver high-quality software solutions, that would streamline team operations. To that end, I created an application to optimize a process that was done frequently by my team members, which was creating Grafana boards and annotations to the boards. In addition, I made databases to replace Excel sheets, which were previously used as the primary method of storing testing data.</p>

                    <p>As an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I was tasked with assisting a professor with solving a research problem. The research problem of focus was the improvement of online STEM education, with a primary focus on the University of Waterloo. My task during the research project was to create a model to predict the likelihood that a student would drop a course from data from the first month of the term. I was able to create a predictive model that made predictions with 67% accuracy. In addition, I presented my results to professors and the lead team at digitalEd - the company that provides the University of Waterloo with online testing and note-sharing software.</p>
