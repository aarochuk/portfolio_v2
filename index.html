During this coop, I worked on making tools to increase efficiency in reporting on testing results. In addition, I created a testing framework to test an application that collected the data on the testing devices used by the team. Furthermore, I served as scrum master during multiple scrums hosting scrum meetings and gaining experience in an agile work environment.</p>

The research problem of focus was the improvement of online STEM education, with a primary focus on the University of Waterloo. My task during the research project was to create a model to predict the likelihood that a student would drop a course from data from the first month of the term. I was able to create a predictive model that made predictions with 67% accuracy. In addition, I presented my results to professors and the lead team at digitalEd - the company that provides the University of Waterloo with online testing and note-sharing software.</p>
